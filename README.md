# Mock PHP Website
Website made using PHP, HTML and CSS during a company recruitment process.  
  
The goal of the website was to create a mock website where the user could:  
-Create an Account (As User)  
-The admin could manage existing accounts (creating new ones, managing their roles in the website, deleting users)  
-The admin could create new products, set their price, update the product and delete that product  
-Subscribe to a existing product  
  
All this done integrated with the Stripe API (https://stripe.com/en-pt)
